# YOLOv8 Inference with GUI and Video Streaming

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows users to stream a video and perform object detection with YOLOv8 in real-time. Additionally, it provides options to recognize objects, save images, and set confidence thresholds for detection.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8.
- Graphical user interface for video streaming and object recognition.
- Option to recognize objects in the video stream.
- Ability to save frames as images.
- Adjustable confidence threshold for object detection.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).

2. **Run the GUI**:
   - Execute the Python script `gui.py` to launch the GUI for video streaming and object detection.

3. **Interact with the GUI**:
   - Stream a video and adjust the confidence threshold for object detection.
   - Click the "Recognize" button to initiate object recognition and view detected objects.
   - Use the "Save Image" button to save frames as image files.
